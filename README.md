# Project Plan is:


## **Stage #1: ML Orchestration, Monitoring, Deployment, and Visualization**
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Goal: Set up a working ML pipeline with Amazon Managed Airflow, SageMaker for model deployment, and basic monitoring.

#### **Tasks:**

1.  **Orchestration Setup with MWAA (Managed Airflow)**
    
    *   Set up an S3 bucket for storing Airflow DAGs.
        
    *   Deploy a Managed Airflow environment on AWS.
        
    *   Write initial Airflow DAGs to orchestrate data ingestion, training, and deployment steps.
        
    *   Test basic DAG execution in MWAA to confirm connectivity and permissions.
        
2.  **Model Training and Deployment with SageMaker**
    
    *   Prepare a SageMaker training job using a pre-trained or retrained LSTM model for stock price prediction.
        
    *   Define a deployment pipeline for SageMaker endpoints.
        
    *   Integrate SageMaker deployment in the Airflow DAG to automatically deploy the model when retraining is needed.
        
    *   Set up monitoring for SageMaker endpoints (e.g., latency, error rates).
        
3.  **Data Ingestion with Lambda and S3**
    
    *   Create a Lambda function to fetch and upload Amazon stock data to S3.
        
    *   Schedule Lambda to run at regular intervals (e.g., daily or weekly) using Amazon CloudWatch Events.
        
    *   Integrate the Lambda ingestion step into the Airflow DAG to trigger model updates as new data arrives.
        
4.  **Monitoring and Alerting**
    
    *   Use CloudWatch to monitor Lambda executions, Airflow DAGs, and SageMaker model endpoints.
        
    *   Configure Amazon SNS alerts to notify you of any pipeline failures.
        
5.  **Visualization**
    
    *   Set up a basic visualization tool (like a simple Jupyter notebook or a Lambda-powered API endpoint) to display and track model predictions.
        
    *   Optionally, use QuickSight or an external dashboarding tool for enhanced visualization.
        

## **Stage #2: Infrastructure as Code (IaC)**
------------------------------------------

### Goal: Move infrastructure setup to code using Terraform, with automated deployment from GitHub via CodePipeline and CodeBuild.

#### **Tasks:**

1.  **Store Code in GitHub**
    
    *   Create a GitHub repository to store Terraform configurations, Airflow DAGs, and deployment scripts.
        
    *   Use GitHub to track changes and enable version control for all infrastructure and code components.
        
2.  **Terraform Configurations for AWS Resources**
    
    *   Write Terraform templates for:
        
        *   MWAA environment setup, including S3 buckets and IAM roles.
            
        *   SageMaker training and deployment resources.
            
        *   Lambda function for data ingestion.
            
        *   SNS topics for monitoring notifications.
            
    *   Define outputs in Terraform for easy reference to essential resources (e.g., S3 bucket name, SageMaker endpoint URL).
        
3.  **Automate Terraform Deployment with CodePipeline and CodeBuild**
    
    *   Set up CodePipeline with GitHub as the source repository for Terraform configurations.
        
    *   Configure CodeBuild to deploy infrastructure using Terraform (include terraform init, plan, and apply steps).
        
    *   Test end-to-end deployment by making small changes to the Terraform files and confirming that the pipeline applies updates automatically.
        
4.  **Automate Airflow DAG Deployment**
    
    *   Set up a separate CodePipeline for Airflow DAGs, triggered when changes to DAG files are pushed to GitHub.
        
    *   Configure CodeBuild to upload DAG files to the MWAA S3 bucket.
        
    *   Test this pipeline to confirm that new DAGs are automatically deployed and recognized by MWAA.
        
5.  **Documentation and Config Management**
    
    *   Document the IaC process, including instructions for initializing and maintaining the infrastructure.
        
    *   Consider using parameterized variables in Terraform to allow for easy environment setup (e.g., dev, staging, production).
        

## **Stage #3: Advanced Data Pipeline**
------------------------------------

### Goal: Upgrade the data ingestion pipeline using EMR Serverless or Glue for scalability and robust data transformations.

#### **Tasks:**

1.  **Choose Between EMR Serverless or Glue**
    
    *   Compare EMR Serverless and Glue based on your data transformation requirements, scalability, and cost.
        
    *   Decide on the preferred service based on experimentation and research.
        
2.  **Build Data Ingestion and Transformation Pipeline**
    
    *   If using **Glue**:
        
        *   Write Glue jobs to fetch, clean, and transform stock data.
            
        *   Set up Glue crawlers (if needed) to catalog data for analysis.
            
    *   If using **EMR Serverless**:
        
        *   Define Spark jobs for data transformations and ingestion.
            
        *   Set up EMR configurations and IAM roles to enable access to S3 and other resources.
            
3.  **Integrate the Data Pipeline with MWAA**
    
    *   Update the Airflow DAG to trigger Glue or EMR Serverless jobs for data ingestion.
        
    *   Configure Airflow task dependencies so that model retraining and deployment occur only after successful data ingestion.
        
4.  **Performance and Cost Optimization**
    
    *   Set up CloudWatch metrics to monitor the cost and runtime of Glue or EMR jobs.
        
    *   Adjust resource configurations for Glue (e.g., workers, memory) or EMR (e.g., node count) based on observed usage.
        
5.  **Pipeline Testing and Error Handling**
    
    *   Run end-to-end tests to validate the ingestion pipeline and confirm data correctness.
        
    *   Implement retry logic and error handling in Airflow for Glue or EMR job failures.
        
6.  **Documentation and Final Cleanup**
    
    *   Document the data pipeline architecture, configurations, and troubleshooting steps.
        
    *   Optimize the DAG structure and Airflow dependencies for streamlined production use.
